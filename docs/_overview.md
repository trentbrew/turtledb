# Overview

## Key Takeaways from Your Braindump

### 1. **TurtleDB’s Role**

- **Client-side, in-memory, reactive graph state management** system.
- Integrates with various persistence layers (Localbase for offline, Pocketbase/other for cloud).
- Not a database itself, but an orchestrator for data consistency, reactivity, and UI logic.

### 2. **Schema-Driven, Type-Safe**

- Strong emphasis on schema: node/edge types, descriptions, synonyms, and data shapes.
- Factories and selectors/composables for ergonomic, type-safe access.
- The schema is the bridge between natural language, logic, and data.

### 3. **Natural Language Query (NLQ) Ambition**

- You want TurtleDB to be “remarkably good” at handling NLQ.
- The architecture includes an NLP pre-processor, schema embedder, query mapper, and a Prolog-inspired logic engine.
- The schema’s descriptions and synonyms are crucial for mapping NLQ to graph queries.

### 4. **Access Control**

- There’s a strong argument for TurtleDB to enforce access control client-side, especially for offline and UI feedback.
- The schema can (and should) include access control at the node/edge type and instance level.
- Default: everything is private (owner-only), with options for public, or role-based (viewer, editor, owner) at type or instance level.
- This is layered: backend auth for graph access, TurtleDB for fine-grained, reactive, offline enforcement.

### 5. **Cardinality & Permissions in Schema**

- Cardinality is best expressed in the `source` and `target` properties of edge types (with `multiple` and `required` flags).
- Permissions are best modeled as an `accessControl` object, supporting public, role-based, and instance-level overrides.

### 6. **Framework-Agnostic Vision**

- The core logic (graph, schema, factories, access control, NLQ) should be framework-agnostic.
- Reactivity and state management should be pluggable (adapters for Vue, React, etc.).
- Persistence and sync layers are also pluggable.

## How This Informs Access Control

- **You’re on the right track:**
  The schema-driven, layered access control model is both robust and flexible. It allows for:
  - UI-level enforcement (instant feedback, offline security)
  - Backend-level enforcement (canonical, final authority)
  - NLQ integration (queries respect permissions)
- **Implementation:**
  - Extend your schema types (`NodeTypeConfig`, `EdgeTypeConfig`, `Node`, `Edge`) with `accessControl`.
  - The core logic (and eventually the Prolog-inspired engine) should always check access control before returning or mutating data.
  - UI and NLQ layers should use these checks to filter/shape results and available actions.

## Next Steps / Suggestions

1. **Schema Update:**

   - Make sure your schema supports `accessControl` at both type and instance levels.
   - Use the refined cardinality structure in edge definitions.

2. **Core Logic:**

   - Implement access control checks in all CRUD and query operations.
   - Provide clear error messages or filtered results when access is denied.

3. **NLQ Layer:**

   - Ensure the NLQ pipeline is aware of permissions, so queries like “show me all posts” only return what the user can see.

4. **Adapters:**

   - Keep the core logic framework-agnostic; provide adapters for reactivity and persistence.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the access control model and how developers can extend or override it for their needs.

## Reference: Access Control Mermaid Diagram

Here’s the access control flow, as discussed in your context:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph UI ["User Interface"]
        A[User Action/Query]
        A --> B{Is data access allowed?}
    end

    subgraph TDB ["Turtledb JSR Package"]
        subgraph CORE ["Turtledb Core Resolver"]
            B --> C{Authentication Context User ID, Roles}
            C --> D[Prolog-inspired Logic Engine]
        end

        subgraph DATA ["Turtledb Data Layer"]
            D --> E[Graph Store Nodes & Edges]
            F[User-Defined Schema/Config]
        end
    end

    %% Internal connections within Turtledb for access control
    F --> D
    F --> G[Node Type Config with Type-level ACL]
    F --> H[Edge Type Config with Type-level ACL]
    E --> I[Node/Edge Instance with Instance-level ACL]
    G --> D
    H --> D
    I --> D

    %% External connections (for context)
    J[Backend Auth Service e.g., Pocketbase] --> C
    K[Query Results filtered by ACL] --> A

    %% Data flow and decision points
    D -- "Evaluates Rules (from F, G, H, I)" --> K
    B -- "If allowed" --> D
    B -- "If denied" --> L[Access Denied Error/Message]
    L --> A
```

**If you want to move forward with access control implementation, I can help you:**

- Update your schema types and example schema.
- Add access control checks to your core logic.
- Scaffold tests for permission enforcement.
