- **Framework-Agnostic Core**
  Designed for seamless integration with any JavaScript framework (Vue, React, Angular, Svelte) via adapters.

- **Pluggable Backend Sync**
  Easily connect to various backend services (Firebase, PocketBase, Supabase, custom APIs) through a generic API abstraction.

- **Offline-First & Caching**
  Robust client-side persistence using LocalBase (IndexedDB) for offline support and fast data access.

- **Extensible for Natural Language Queries**
  Schema-driven architecture enables advanced natural language understanding and semantic search capabilities.

- **Type-Safe**
  Built with TypeScript for reliability and maintainability.

turtledb simplifies complex state management by centralizing your application's data in a unified graph, making it easier to build performant, resilient, and intelligently queryable applications.
